# techDocPageProject
Technical Document Page that I created for a Free Code Camp project  
Made a technical Documentation page for using video game emulaotrs  
The side nav bar is ugly, but I don't really have enough sections to make it look normal  
If I coud have all the tests pass, I would have focused on making a normal looking navbar that would
be fixed to the top of the page instead.  
Passed all FCC tests.
